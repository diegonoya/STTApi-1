# STTApi
TypeScript Client API for Star Trek Timelines

This repository is not really useful by itself. It's designed to be used as a submodule in the [Star Trek Timelines spreadsheet tool](https://github.com/IAmPicard/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet) and the [Voyage monitor tool](https://github.com/IAmPicard/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet/tree/master/voyage).
